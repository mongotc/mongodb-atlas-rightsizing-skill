description: Generate MongoDB Atlas cluster rightsizing recommendations by pulling hardware metrics (CPU, memory, disk IOPS, disk utilization, connections) from the Atlas Admin API and comparing them against tier-appropriate thresholds. Use this skill whenever the user asks about Atlas cluster sizing, whether a cluster is over- or under-provisioned, cost optimization for Atlas clusters, scaling recommendations, "is my cluster too big/small", capacity planning, or wants a report on cluster hardware utilization. Also trigger for requests to audit multiple clusters/projects for sizing issues.

# MongoDB Atlas Rightsizing

Produces a data-backed recommendation (scale up / scale down / no change) for one or more Atlas
clusters, using real hardware metrics from the Atlas Admin API rather than guesswork.

## Prerequisites

The user needs Atlas API credentials with at least **Project Read Only** access:
- An Atlas **Service Account** (`client_id` / `client_secret`, OAuth2) — preferred, or
- Legacy **Organization/Project API key** (`public_key` / `private_key`, HTTP Digest auth)

They also need the **Project (Group) ID** — found in Atlas UI under Project Settings, or via
`GET /api/atlas/v2/groups`.

If the user doesn't have these yet, point them to:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/

## Workflow

1. **Collect inputs** from the user (or a config file — see `scripts/config.example.json`):
   - Project ID (`groupId`)
   - Cluster name(s) — or "all" to audit every cluster in the project
   - Credentials (never ask the user to paste secrets into chat if avoidable — prefer env vars:
     `ATLAS_CLIENT_ID`/`ATLAS_CLIENT_SECRET` or `ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY`/`ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY`)
   - Lookback window (default: 7 days — long enough to smooth daily cycles, short enough to stay
     current). Offer 30 days if the user cares about monthly peaks (e.g. batch jobs, reporting).
     For spot-checking a live/in-progress situation, `--hours` (e.g. `--hours 2`) runs the same
     evaluation over a sub-day window at 1-minute granularity (1-hour beyond 36 hours) — always reports "low" confidence
     (see references/thresholds.md) and should not replace the default 7-day audit for an actual
     sizing decision.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/rightsizing.py \
     --group-id <groupId> \
     --cluster <clusterName>   # omit to audit all clusters in the project \
     --days 7 \
     --out-dir ./rightsizing-report
   ```
   This writes `report.md` (human-readable) and `report.json` (structured) to `--out-dir`.
   See `scripts/rightsizing.py --help` for auth flag details.

3. **What the script does** (for each target cluster):
   - Fetches cluster config: `GET /groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}` — current tier and
     provisioned IOPS across every region config, and whether compute/storage autoscaling is on
     (noted in the verdict: with autoscaling on, a scale verdict is about the autoscaling bounds).
   - Fetches the process list for the cluster: `GET /groups/{groupId}/processes` (all pages),
     keeping only processes whose host matches the host prefix and domain in the cluster's own
     `connectionStrings.standard` (`<prefix>-shard-NN-NN` / `<prefix>-config-NN-NN`), so clusters
     that share a name prefix (`prod` / `prod-analytics`) aren't mixed. Exits if nothing matches;
     paused clusters are reported as `paused`.
   - Fetches measurements per process: `GET /groups/{groupId}/processes/{processId}/measurements`
     with `granularity=PT1H` and `period=P{days}D`, for the metric set in
     `references/metrics.md`.
   - Computes p50/p95/max and data coverage for each metric across the window, per node, and
     evaluates each node on its own. A replica set's (or shard's) verdict is the worst node's —
     pooling samples across nodes would let idle secondaries dilute a hot primary.
   - Applies the decision rules in `references/thresholds.md` to classify each cluster as
     **scale up**, **scale down**, **change disk/IOPS only** (every trigger that fired is a
     disk IOPS, latency, or space trigger), or **no change**, with a
     confidence level based on how many days of data were available and how consistently the
     signal held.

4. **Present the results**: show `report.md` inline (it's short and this is usually what the
   user actually wants to read), and mention `report.json` is available if they're feeding this
   into another system or want to diff runs over time.

5. **Caveats to state explicitly in the report** (the script includes these, but repeat them if
   summarizing verbally):
   - This is a recommendation, not an autoscaling action — nothing is changed in Atlas.
   - Metrics reflect the lookback window only; call out if it doesn't cover a known peak period
     (month-end batch, Black Friday, etc.) and suggest widening `--days` or targeting a specific
     historical window if the API's period supports it.
   - Sharded clusters: the script detects sharded topology automatically (by grouping processes
     on their `replicaSetName` — each shard, and the config server, is its own replica set) and
     produces a separate verdict per shard, plus an informational-only section for mongos routers
     (no scale-up/down verdict, since routers have no local storage/WT cache to evaluate). This
     grouping was implemented against the documented Atlas API schema but has not been verified
     against a live sharded cluster — sanity-check the shard breakdown against the Atlas UI the
     first time you run it against one, and say so in the summary if you haven't verified it
     yourself either. If shards have different provisioned IOPS ("asymmetric" sharding), the
     IOPS-vs-provisioned threshold is skipped for all shards rather than risk comparing a shard's
     usage against the wrong shard's ceiling — the report notes when this happens.
   - Free/shared tier (M0/M2/M5) clusters don't expose full hardware measurements — the script
     will note this and skip metric-based analysis for them.

## Optional: database-internal diagnostics (when the user has DB credentials)

The Atlas Admin API only sees OS/hardware-level metrics. It can tell you the box is under
pressure, but not *why* — a CPU spike from a missing index looks identical, from Atlas's view,
to one from genuine undersizing. If the user has (or can get) a MongoDB user with `clusterMonitor`
and read access — not just Atlas API credentials — run `scripts/db_diagnostics.py` alongside
`rightsizing.py`, then run `scripts/merge_verdict.py` to combine them into one report. This is
what lets the report say "add an index" instead of "buy a bigger cluster" when that's the actual
fix. Ask the user whether they have this level of access before assuming Atlas-only; don't ask
them to create new database users just for this unless they want to. **Not every user running
this skill will have DB access — `merge_verdict.py` works fine with only the rightsizing report
and produces a clearly-labeled Atlas-only output in that case; never block on this step.**

```bash
python scripts/db_diagnostics.py --uri "<connection string>" --sample-interval 60 --out-dir ./rightsizing-report

python scripts/merge_verdict.py --rightsizing-report ./rightsizing-report/report.json \
    --db-diagnostics ./rightsizing-report/db_diagnostics.json --out-dir ./rightsizing-report
# (omit --db-diagnostics entirely for Atlas-only customers)
```

Note `db_diagnostics.py` takes at least `--sample-interval` seconds to run (it samples
`serverStatus()` twice to compute rates from cumulative counters) — tell the user before starting
it. `merge_verdict.py` is instant — it only reads the two JSON files, no network calls. Read
`references/db-diagnostics.md` for the actual combination rules (what "agrees," what counts as a
"disagreement" to surface rather than silently resolve, and why the working-set-vs-cache-size
comparison is gated the way it is) before hand-tuning `merge_verdict.py`'s thresholds.

## Files

- `scripts/rightsizing.py` — pulls Atlas hardware metrics. Self-contained, only depends on `requests`.
- `scripts/db_diagnostics.py` — optional second data source: `serverStatus()`/`dbStats()`/
  `collStats()` via a direct MongoDB connection. Depends on `pymongo`.
- `scripts/merge_verdict.py` — combines rightsizing.py's report.json with db_diagnostics.py's
  db_diagnostics.json (if available) into one merged report. No dependencies beyond stdlib; works
  fine with only the rightsizing report (Atlas-only mode) when the user has no DB credentials.
- `scripts/config.example.json` — example config file (alternative to CLI flags/env vars, useful
  for auditing many clusters across projects on a schedule).
- `references/metrics.md` — the exact Atlas measurement names pulled and why each matters.
- `references/thresholds.md` — the decision rules (the actual rightsizing logic) and the M-tier
  reference table (vCPU/RAM per tier) used to reason about headroom.
- `references/db-diagnostics.md` — how to combine the two data sources, including what to do
  when they disagree.

Read `references/thresholds.md` before hand-tuning any thresholds for a user's risk tolerance
(e.g. a user who says "we never want to be CPU-bound" wants a lower scale-up trigger than default).

## Handling common follow-ups

- **"Why is it recommending X?"** — Read back the relevant rule from `references/thresholds.md`
  and the actual p95/max numbers from `report.json` that triggered it. Don't just restate the
  recommendation.
- **"What would the new tier cost?"** — The script doesn't fetch pricing (Atlas doesn't expose a
  stable public pricing API). Point the user to the Atlas UI pricing calculator or their billing
  page instead of guessing a number.
- **"Apply this change"** — Out of scope for this skill by design (read-only). If the user wants
  it automated, that's a different task: modifying the cluster via
  `PATCH /groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}` — flag the risk (in-place tier changes trigger
  a rolling restart) and confirm explicitly before ever writing that code for them.
