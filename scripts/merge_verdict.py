"""
Merge an Atlas hardware-metrics rightsizing report (rightsizing.py) with database-internal
diagnostics (db_diagnostics.py) into one combined report.

rightsizing.py answers "is the hardware under pressure." db_diagnostics.py answers "why, and is
more hardware actually the fix." This script combines them per the rules documented in
references/db-diagnostics.md — read that file before changing the thresholds below.

--db-diagnostics is OPTIONAL. Not every customer running this skill will have (or want to create)
database-level credentials — only an Atlas API key is required to run rightsizing.py at all. When
--db-diagnostics is omitted, it passes the Atlas-only verdicts
through unchanged, clearly labeled as Atlas-only, with a note that db_diagnostics.py is available
for deeper root-cause analysis if DB credentials become available later.

Core rule (see references/db-diagnostics.md): when the two sources disagree, SURFACE the
disagreement — never silently prefer one number over the other.

This script is READ-ONLY and makes no network calls; it only reads the two JSON files.

Usage:
  python merge_verdict.py --rightsizing-report ./report/report.json \\
      --db-diagnostics ./report/db_diagnostics.json --out-dir ./report

  # Atlas-only (no DB credentials available) — still produces a valid, clearly-labeled report:
  python merge_verdict.py --rightsizing-report ./report/report.json --out-dir ./report
