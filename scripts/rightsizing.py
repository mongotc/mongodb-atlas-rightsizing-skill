"""
MongoDB Atlas rightsizing report.

Pulls hardware measurements for one or more clusters from the Atlas Admin API,
compares them against tier-appropriate thresholds (see ../references/thresholds.md),
and writes a human-readable report.md and a machine-readable report.json.

Auth (pick one):
  Service account (preferred):
    --client-id / --client-secret, or env ATLAS_CLIENT_ID / ATLAS_CLIENT_SECRET
  API key (legacy, HTTP Digest):
    --public-key / --private-key, or env ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY / ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY

This script is READ-ONLY. It never modifies a cluster.

Usage:
  python rightsizing.py --group-id <id> --cluster mycluster --days 7 --out-dir ./report
  python rightsizing.py --group-id <id> --days 30 --out-dir ./report   # all clusters in project
  python rightsizing.py --group-id <id> --cluster mycluster --hours 2 --out-dir ./report
      # quick/ad-hoc check of a live situation — always reports 'low' confidence, not a
      # substitute for the default 7-day audit

Only dependency: `requests` (pip install requests).
